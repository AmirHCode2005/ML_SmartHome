# 🏠 Smart Home Energy Efficiency Prediction

## 📘 Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to predict **energy efficiency** in smart homes.  
It is a **Binary Classification** problem, where the goal is to classify homes based on their energy performance levels.

## 🧠 Project Highlights
- **Type:** Binary Classification  
- **Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Dataset:** `smart_home_efficiency.csv` — includes features related to building design and environment.

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** – cleaning, handling missing values, and scaling features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – understanding feature correlations and class distribution.  
3. **Model Training** – logistic regression and other ML algorithms.  
4. **Class Imbalance Handling** – applying `class_weight='balanced'` to improve minority class recognition.  
5. **Model Evaluation** – using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 🚧 Challenges
The dataset was **imbalanced**, causing the model to initially favor the majority class.  
By rebalancing the classes, we achieved a fairer and more meaningful performance tradeoff.

## 📊 Results
- Improved recognition of the minority class.  
- Slight decrease in accuracy but higher model fairness.  
- Visualized performance using confusion matrix and ROC curves.
