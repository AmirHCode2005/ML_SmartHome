# 🏠 Smart Home Energy Efficiency Prediction

## 📘 Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning** to predict **energy efficiency** in smart homes.  
It explores how environmental and design factors influence energy consumption, helping optimize smart home systems.

## 🧠 Project Highlights
- **Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Techniques:** Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Model Optimization  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Dataset:** Custom dataset containing smart home energy efficiency records (`smart_home_efficiency.csv`)

## ⚙️ Key Steps
1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
2. Model training and evaluation  
3. Handling **class imbalance** — using `class_weight` in Logistic Regression to improve recall  
4. Model testing and visualization of results  

## 🚧 Challenges
The dataset was **imbalanced**, leading the model to favor the majority class.  
To address this, class weights were introduced — improving the model’s fairness while slightly reducing overall accuracy.

## 📊 Results
- The model achieved consistent predictions after rebalancing.  
- Energy efficiency classification became more reliable for both classes (0 and 1).  

## 📁 Files Included
- `energy_efficiency_project.ipynb` → Main Jupyter Notebook  
- `smart_home_efficiency.csv` → Dataset used in the analysis
